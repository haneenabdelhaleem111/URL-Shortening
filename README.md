## My process

### Built with
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS] - For styles


### What I learned

Recapping what I learned from this challenge:

React.js: 
working with reusable components is a highlight 
useEffect hooks used also 
CSS:
using tailwindcss was an addition also
